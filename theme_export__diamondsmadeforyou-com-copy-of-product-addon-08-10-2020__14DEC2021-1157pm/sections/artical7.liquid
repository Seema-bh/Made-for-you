        <p>To put it very simply, a lab-grown diamond is a diamond that is grown in a laboratory. Many people wonder whether something that is grown in a lab can be considered a real diamond. The short answer is, yes! Lab-grown diamonds are real diamonds. In fact, they have the same chemical and physical composition as mined diamonds. But, we totally get that you need more than just our word. To help you understand why lab-grown diamonds are the real deal, let’s take a look at how they are created.

                <h5>Two Ways of Creating Lab-Grown Diamonds</h5>
                <p>As the name quite literally suggests, lab-grown diamonds are grown in laboratories. A diamond that is created in a laboratory could also be known as lab-made, man-made, engineered or cultured. Diamonds can be grown in laboratories in one of two ways. Firstly, they can be created by mimicking the earth’s natural high pressure and temperature environment. If this is the case, these diamonds will be called high-pressure, high-temperature or HPHT diamonds and they will be manufactured in a large mechanical press. The other process is known as chemical vapour deposition (CVD). CVD diamonds are created by using a seed of a diamond and then growing it layer by layer in a chamber known as a plasma reactor. These laboratory creations are formed in just a few weeks and look exactly like natural diamonds, with the same chemical composition as them.</p>
                    <h5>Formation of Natural Diamonds</h5>
                    <p>Natural diamonds, on the other hand, are formed roughly 200 kilometres below the earth’s surface. Diamonds form naturally when pure carbon undergoes incredibly high pressure and temperature conditions within the earth’s mantle for several years. These diamonds take a few hundred years to be formed and require extensive mining to be uncovered and used commercially.

                <h5>Lab-Grown Diamonds Are Identical to Natural Diamonds</h5>
                <p>Lab-grown diamonds, although man-made, are physically and chemically identical to natural diamonds that are mined. Nobody can tell the two apart and a highly specialised piece of equipment is used to sort the lab-created diamonds from the natural ones. Since both the composition and the structure of engineered diamonds are the same as natural ones,<strong>America’s Federal Trade Commission (FTC) amended its Jewelry Guide to remove the word ‘natural’ from the definition of a diamond.</strong>This means that a diamond is a diamond, regardless of whether it comes out of the ground or was made in a laboratory.</p>
                <h5>Lab-Grown Diamonds – A Great Choice!</h5>
                <p>If lab-grown diamonds and natural diamonds are exactly the same – is one better than the other? Absolutely! Lab-made diamonds have a slight edge over natural diamonds. Lab-grown stones do not require extensive mining, which means that obtaining a diamond is no longer an expensive and long-drawn process. This directly translates into more <strong>affordable diamonds</strong> for you. </p>
                <p>For years we’ve been told that only mined diamonds that are rare are real, but that is no longer the case. Lab-grown diamonds are just as real as natural ones – but they are heavy on style while being lighter on your pocket!</p>
