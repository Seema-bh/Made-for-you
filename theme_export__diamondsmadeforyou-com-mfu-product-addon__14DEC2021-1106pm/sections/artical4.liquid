                <h5>Weekly Cleaning</h5>
                <p>As much as we all love diamonds, they’re actually magnets for grease. Whenever you touch your diamond, the oil from your hands gets transferred onto the surface of the stone. This can affect its fire and brilliance. To get rid of this grease, you need to soak your diamond jewellery in a solution of warm water with a couple of drops of mild soap. After soaking your jewellery for a while, you can use a clean, new soft toothbrush to gently remove any dirt still on the piece. Make sure you reserve the toothbrush only for your jewellery in the future. Once you’re done gently scrubbing, you can rinse and then wipe your diamond jewellery dry with a lint-free cloth.</p>
                <h5>Storing Jewellery</h5>
                <p>Diamonds, as we all know, are one of the hardest substances known to man. What this means is that one diamond can easily scratch another diamond or even any other gemstone. So it’s important you store each piece of jewellery separately to avoid any unnecessary damage. You can invest in a fabric-lined jewellery box that has individual compartments for each piece of jewellery or you can wrap your diamond jewellery in soft tissue before storing it to keep it safe.

                <h5>What to Avoid</h5>
                <p>As far as possible, you should avoid touching the diamond directly. If you’re wearing a diamond ring, remember to hold the band while putting it on or taking it off. This way you don’t have to worry about the grease from your fingers getting transferred to the surface of the diamond. When you’re cleaning your jewellery, you need to be very careful about the mild soap you use. Avoid any kind of body wash or soap that has a moisturiser in it as this will leave a film over your diamonds. You should also avoid using any kind of bleach, household cleaner or even toothpaste on your jewellery. In fact, you should remove your jewellery and store it carefully before handling these cleaners. You should also remove your diamond jewellery when you’re applying moisturiser or sunscreen, washing dishes, or even while you’re using hairspray.</p>
                <h5>Diamond Jewellery and Sanitizer</h5>
                <p>Many of us regularly rub our hands with sanitizer to kill germs and bacteria. If you’re wondering about the effect hand sanitizer has on your lab-grown diamond ring, we have some good news for you. It’s safe for you to use sanitizer on hard stones like diamonds as well as precious metals like silver, titanium, platinum and other plated metals. But, if you are wearing a ring that has a soft stone, such as an opal or pearl, you’d be better off removing it before rubbing sanitizer on your hands.</p>
                <p>Cleaning your jewellery isn’t difficult. A quick soak and brush once a week is enough to keep your lab-grown diamond jewellery shining bright. Just remember to always treat your diamonds with love and care for a bright shimmer that never dulls.</p>
